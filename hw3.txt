1. Use the d logret 6stocks dataset to answer the questions.
 >   filename = "d_logret_6stocks.txt"
 >   table <- read.table(filename,header=T)
 >   attach(table)
	(1) Regress the retrun Pfizer on the returns of Exxon (with intercept). Report the estimated coefficients.
	 >   PonE <- lm(Pfizer~Exxon)
	 >   coef(PonE)
		 (Intercept)        Exxon 
		-0.005325057  0.354648962
	(2) Generate an ANOVA table to conclude if above regression effects are significant
	 >   anova(PonE)
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: Pfizer
		          Df    Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)   
		Exxon      1 0.0041609 0.0041609   8.774 0.004328 **
		Residuals 62 0.0294022 0.0004742                    
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
	    Since the p value is less than 0.05(0.004328> 0.05), we can conclude that the regression effests are significant
	(3) We now ignore the time series features of all returns, and consider them independent we also treat
all weekly returns of Pfizer, Exxon and Citigroup as Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Perform oneway ANOVA for group 1-3.
	 >   g1 <- Pfizer
	 >   g2 <- Exxon
	 >   g3 <- Citigroup
	 >   y <- c(g1, g2, g3)
	 >   x <- c(rep(1,64), rep(2,64), rep(3,64))
	 >   singleAnova <- lm(y~factor(x)) 
	 >   anova(singleAnova)
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: y
          		 Df   Sum Sq    Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
		factor(x)   2 0.001934 0.00096712  1.4351 0.2407
		Residuals 189 0.127366 0.00067390 
	   Since the p value is greater than 0.05, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. In other words we cannot reject that they have same means

2. Use the dataset ’juul’ in package ’ISwR’ to answer the question.
   >   library(ISwR)
   >   attach(juul)
	(1) Conduct one-way ANOVA test to test if the mean of igf1 of each level of tanner are the same?
	 >   juulFit <- lm(igf1 ~ factor(tanner))
	 >   anova(juulFit)
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: igf1
          		      Df   Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    
		factor(tanner)   4 12696217 3174054  228.35 < 2.2e-16 ***
		Residuals      787 10939116   13900                      
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
	    Since the p value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the mean of eact level of tanner aren't the same/
	(2) What is the mean of igf1 in each level of tanner?
	 >   tapply(igf1, tanner, mean, na.rm = T)
		       1        2        3        4        5 
		207.4727 352.6714 483.2222 513.0172 465.3344 
	(3) If there is any difference, which ones appear to be different? (Use pairwise t test for each pair of
level with bonferroni method)
	 >   pairwise.t.test(x = igf1, g = tanner, p.adj = 'bonferroni')

			Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD 

		data:  igf1 and tanner 
	
		  1       2       3     4    
		2 < 2e-16 -       -     -    
		3 < 2e-16 9.9e-08 -     -    
		4 < 2e-16 5.5e-13 1.000 -    
		5 < 2e-16 1.3e-11 1.000 0.048

		P value adjustment method: bonferroni 
	   At the 0.05 significance level, we can say that 3 and 4, and 3 and 5 have the same means, but others have a different mean

3. We want to test the wings length of three species of eagles. The wings lengths are measured in
centimeters. There are three species of eagles: harpy eagle, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle. Please
write up the R code to do the following.
Harpy eagle 100, 102, 99, 105, 97, 98, 92, 108
Golden eagle 90, 88, 84, 97, 80, 91, 86, 82
While-tailed eagle 72, 77, 64, 75, 66, 80, 82, 79
	 >   harpyEagle <- c(100, 102, 99, 105, 97, 98, 92, 108)
	 >   goldenEagle <- c(90, 88, 84, 97, 80, 91, 86, 82)
	 >   whiteTailEagle <- c(72, 77, 64, 75, 66, 80, 82, 79)
	(1) Please check the normality of the wings length of each species of eagles at significance level 0.05.
	 >   shapiro.test(harpyEagle)

			Shapiro-Wilk normality test

		data:  harpyEagle
		W = 0.98421, p-value = 0.9807

	 >   shapiro.test(goldenEagle)

			Shapiro-Wilk normality test

		data:  goldenEagle
		W = 0.97559, p-value = 0.9379

	 >   shapiro.test(whiteTailEagle)

			Shapiro-Wilk normality test

		data:  whiteTailEagle
		W = 0.91923, p-value = 0.4236
	Since all the p values are greater than 0.05, we fail to rehect the null hypotheses and conclude that normality is met for all of the given distribution of wings length.
	(2) Compare the variance of the wings length of different species of eagles with Bartlett’s test at
significance level 0.05.
	 >   bartlett.test(list(harpyEagle, goldenEagle, whiteTailEagle))

			Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances

		data:  list(harpyEagle, goldenEagle, whiteTailEagle)
		Bartlett's K-squared = 0.55739, df = 2,
		p-value = 0.7568
	   Since the p value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the variance are equal.
	(3) Draw a scatter plot of the residuals of the ANOVA model versus the fitted value of the ANOVA model.
	 >   dataFull<- c(harpyEagle, goldenEagle, whiteTailEagle)
	 >   species <- c(rep("harpyEagle",8), rep("goldenEagle",8), rep("whiteTailEagle",8))
	 >   fullDataEagle <- data.frame(species = species, wingLength = dataFull)
	 >   reg <- lm(wingLength ~ species, data = fullDataEagle)
	 >   resEagle<- reg$residuals
	 >   fitEagle<- reg$fitted.values
	 >   plot(fitEagle, resEagle)
*Image in Blackboard submissions - txt cannot have picture
	(4) Perform one-way ANOVA for the wings length of different species of eagles and conclude if the
means of wings length of different species of eagles are the same at significance level 0.05.
	 >   dataFull<- c(harpyEagle, goldenEagle, whiteTailEagle)
	 >   species <- c(rep("harpyEagle",8), rep("goldenEagle",8), rep("whiteTailEagle",8))
	 >   fullDataEagle <- data.frame(species = species, wingLength = dataFull)
	 >   anova(lm(wingLength ~ species, data = fullDataEagle))
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: wingLength
		          Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    
		species    2 2652.25 1326.12  40.819 5.815e-08 ***
		Residuals 21  682.25   32.49                      
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
	  Sine the p value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null. In other words, at least one on the mean wing length is sigificantly different from the others

Base for 4 and 5

>   ageGroup <-c(rep("15-18", 3), rep ("12-14", 3))
>   groupAScores <- c( 92,88,76,82,62,74)
>   fullGroupA <- data.frame(mathScores = groupAScores, Age = ageGroup)
>   groupBScores <- c( 94,88,73,76,91,78)
>   fullGroupB <- data.frame(mathScores = groupBScores, Age = ageGroup)
>   groupCScores <- c( 95,92,84,94,98,82)
>   fullGroupC <- data.frame(mathScores = groupCScores, Age = ageGroup)

4. Compare the Math scores among three groups without considering age ranges. Test by using α= .05.
	(1) Perform a one-way ANOVA comparing the math scores among three groups.
	 >   totalScores <- c(groupAScores, groupBScores, groupCScores)
	 >   groups <- c(rep("A", 6),rep("B", 6), rep("C", 6))
	 >   anova(lm(totalScores~ factor(groups)))
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: totalScores
 		              Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)  
		factor(groups)  2  430.11 215.056  2.7567 0.09559 .
		Residuals      15 1170.17  78.011                  
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
	 Since the p value is greater than 0.05, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. In other words we cannot reject that they have same means

	(2) Perform a multiple comparison using Bonferroni method.
	 >   pairwise.t.test(totalScores, groups, 	p.adjust="bonferroni")

			Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD 

		data:  totalScores and groups 

		  A    B   
		B 1.00 -   
		C 0.10 0.49	

		P value adjustment method: bonferroni 
	 At the 0.5 significant level, we can say that all of the test scores from the different groups have the same mean since the p values are greater than 0.05
	(3) Perform a multiple comparison using Tukey method.
	 >   testScores <-data.frame(totalScores, groups)
	 >   TukeyHSD(aov(totalScores~groups, data = testScores), conf.level = 0.95)
		  Tukey multiple comparisons of means
 		   95% family-wise confidence level

		Fit: aov(formula = totalScores ~ groups, data = testScores)

		$groups
 		        diff       lwr      upr     p adj
		B-A  4.333333 -8.912161 17.57883 0.6788849
		C-A 11.833333 -1.412161 25.07883 0.0835130
		C-B  7.500000 -5.745495 20.74549 0.3321037
	Since the p values are all greater that 0.05, it shows that non of the data is significant.


5. You want to determine if the mean score on a standardized math test is different among three groups
of schoolchildren ranging in age from 12 to 18. Perform the analysis with an adjustment based on age.
Test by using α= .01.
>   ageGroup <-c(rep("15-18", 3), rep ("12-14", 3))
>   groupAScores <- c( 92,88,76,82,62,74)
>   fullGroupA <- data.frame(mathScores = groupAScores, Age = ageGroup)
>   groupBScores <- c( 94,88,73,76,91,78)
>   fullGroupB <- data.frame(mathScores = groupBScores, Age = ageGroup)
>   groupCScores <- c( 95,92,84,94,98,82)
>   fullGroupC <- data.frame(mathScores = groupCScores, Age = ageGroup)
>   totalScores <- c(groupAScores, groupBScores, groupCScores)
>   fullTestScoreData <- data.frame(testScores, ageGroup = c(rep(ageGroup,3)))
	(1) Using a two-way analysis of covariance, compare the math scores among the three groups and two
age ranges (12-14 and 15-18), assuming the existence of the interaction effect.
	 >   anova(lm(totalScores~groups + ageGroup, data = fullTestScoreData))
		Analysis of Variance Table

		Response: totalScores
		          Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)  
		groups     2  430.11 215.056  2.8466 0.09176 .
		ageGroup   1  112.50 112.500  1.4891 0.24251  
		Residuals 14 1057.67  75.548                  
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
	Since the p valve for for both group and age group are both greather than 0.01, we fail to reject the null nypothesis. 
	(2) Make a two-way interaction plot.
	* For the table age group was sub: 1 = "15-18" and 2 = "12-14
	 >   ageGroupSub <-c(rep(1, 3), rep (2, 3))
	 >   fullTestScoreData <- data.frame(testScores, ageGroup = c(rep(ageGroupSub,3)))
	 >   group <- fullTestScoreData$groups
	 >   testScore <- fullTestScoreData$totalScores
	 >   age <- fullTestScoreData$ageGroup
	 >   interaction.plot(group, age, testScore)

	(3) Check the two assumptions (normality and constant variances) using the qqplot and residual plot
against the fitted values.
	 >   qqnorm(testScore)
	 >   reg <- lm(totalScores~groups + ageGroup, data = fullTestScoreData)
	 >   res <- reg$residuals
	 >   fit <- reg$fitted.values
	 >   plot(fit, res)
